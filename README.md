# Data Structures (Java)

## Introduction

Java is a very common, popular, and stong language. I believe that it is very important for me to learn the fundamentals of this language.

My end goal with Java is to end up with a more natural understand of Object Oriented Programming and develop applications using Spring Boot.

I'm using my CSCI-2270 assignments from college and using a fresh approach to implement them in Java.

I will be using coding practices I've learned at my job to showcase my abilities. All tests will be written by myself.

My C++ implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/josiahroa18/CSCI-2270-Course-Work-Fall-2019).
